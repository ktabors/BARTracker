v1.1
Modified the widget so it works nicely on the iPhone.

Modified the styles (heights and widths), images, etc. to make it iPhone friendly.
Modified the javascript to support cross domain scripting to get the RSS feed.

v1.0 - A Samsung Omnia II widget that shows BART advisories and train arrivals by station.
This is the widget that won the Travel/Entertainment category at the Samsung Mobile Widget Developer Camp in 2009.

I don't have a phone to test this on so there might be a few bugs that don't occur.

Use Eclipse and download the Samsung SDK for widgets. Once you've generated a widget you can load it on your phone or with Opera.

It was written before BART had an API and some of the static content might be out of date.

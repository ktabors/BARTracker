BARTracker - A Samsung Omnia II widget that shows BART advisories and train arrivals by station.
Kyle Taborski

This is the wdiget that won the Travel/Entertainment category at the Samsung Mobile Widget Developer Camp in 2009.

I don't have a phone to test this on so there might be a few bugs that don't occur.

Use Eclipse and download the Samsung SDK for widgets. Once you've generated a widget you can load it on your phone or with Opera.

It was written before BART had an API and some of the static content might be out of date.
